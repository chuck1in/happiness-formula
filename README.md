# happiness-formula

ðŸ‘€ I am looking for a way to make everyone happy. If you happen to know the answer, please let me know by improving the javascript below!


```javascript
const world = [];
const happiness = (world) => {
  // Get happiness
  const peace = (world) => {
    // Get peace
    const love = (anybody) => {
      // Get love
    };
    return love;
  };
  return peace;
};
const peace = happiness(world);
const love = peace(world);
world.map((anybody) => love(anybody));

```
